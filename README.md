mcMMOInjector allows skill abilities to be disabled and allow finer 
control over mcMMO skills. mcMMOInjector accomplishes this by
loading skill classes before [mcMMO](https://github.com/mcMMO-Dev/mcMMO-Classic). mcMMOInjector currently only supports
a few skills. If you want anything added feel free to make a pull request.
mcMMOInjector only supports [mcMMO classic](https://github.com/mcMMO-Dev/mcMMO-Classic).
